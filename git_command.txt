A quick note: git init and git clone can be easily confused. At a high level, they can both be used to "initialize a new git repository."
However, git clone is dependent on git init. git clone is used to create a copy of an existing repository.
Internally, git clone first calls git init to create a new repository.
It then copies the data from the existing repository, and checks out a new set of working files. Learn more on the git clone page.
